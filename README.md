# The Eisenhower Method
The "Eisenhower Method" stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower: "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent."

Using the Eisenhower Decision Principle, tasks are evaluated using the criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent,and then placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower Matrix (also known as an "Eisenhower Box" or "Eisenhower Decision Matrix" Tasks are then handled as follows:
Tasks in
-Important/Urgent quadrant are done immediately and personally e.g. crises, deadlines, problems.
-Important/Not Urgent quadrant get an end date and are done personally e.g. relationships, planning, recreation.
-Unimportant/Urgent quadrant are delegated e.g. interruptions, meetings, activities.
-Unimportant/Not Urgent quadrant are dropped e.g. time wasters, pleasant activities, trivia.

This method is said to have been used by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
